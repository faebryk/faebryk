# Coding guidelines

## Formatting, Linting, ...
Make sure to install all development requirements by running 
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Install pre-commit into your faebryk repository:
```
pre-commit install
```

From now on when commiting, "pre-commit" will run our formatting & linting tools.
